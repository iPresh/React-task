### Notable differences between HTML & JSX  
- In JSX, you need to return a single parent element. However, HTML allows you to do whatever you want.
- You can implement JavaScript directly in JSX, but you can't do that in HTML. For HTML, you'll need a script tag or external Javascript file to implement it.
- Self-closing tags in JSX must have the forward slash. On the other hand, the forward slash is optional in HTML 
- Event listeners in JSX are written in camelCase. For example, ``onClick`` in JSX, whereas in HTML, they are written in lowercase - ``onclick``.
- In JSX, you use ``className`` and ``HTMLFor`` attributes. You can't use ``class`` and ``for`` since both are reserved keywords in JavaScript. But in HTML, you can use class and for attributes.   

### Why canâ€™t browsers read JSX?  
Browsers can't read JSX because it's not a valid JavaScript. Browsers can only read JavaScript objects but JSX in not a regular JavaScript object
